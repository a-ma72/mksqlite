Version 2.5 (build 133 - 9. Feb. 2017)
- Changes on non-SQL commands:
  -- 'filename':
     Bugfix, ignored the given database id (always returned the name of the first database)
  -- 'status':
     When called with no arguments (or 0 as dbid) mksqlite('status') writes the statuses for 
     each database id to the command window, as before. If called as function (status = mksqlite(...)), 
     a cell array with respective strings "OPEN" or "CLOSED" will be returned with 
     no output to the command window.
     When called with a database id other than 0, the status only for this id is written to command window. 
     If called as function a respective string "OPEN" or "CLOSED" will be returned, with 
     no output to the command window.
  -- 'result_type':
     Same issue as with 'status'. Causes crash, when called with no arguments.
- Raised the number of available database ids to 10.
- Bugfix: Bind array with empty fields (GitHub issue #6, thx to Knut Voigtlaender)
- Fixed: Building mksqlite with buildit.m failed on linux using newer MATLAB versions.
- Long running calls of mksqlite may be aborted by pressing Ctrl+C now.
- SQLite3 update (3.16.2)

Version 2.4 (build 123 - 29. Aug. 2016)
- Removed some typos
- Bugfix: sql.m checks for 'typedBLOBs' mode before testing tailing struct arguments now.
- Bugfix: Crash, if mksqlite is called to set flags (i.e. 'streaming') with an empty argument
- Bugfix: MATLAB crashed under some circumstances when freeing a persistent handle 
  that was created in an object derived from 'handle'.
- Bugfix: mksqlite('lang', nr) accepted nr > 1, that later leads to a crash
- Added new command mksqlite( dbid, 'filename', database ) to get the filename of a database.
  If the database is temporary (memory based) or doesn't exist, an empty string will be returned.
- SQLite3 update (3.14.1)
  
Version 2.3 (build 118 - 3. Jun. 2016)
- Implementations of sqlites application-defined functions for MATLAB functions
- Bugfix: Scalar MATLAB logical arrays were read flawy
- SQLite update to 3.13.0

Version 2.2  (build 110 - 18. Apr. 2016)
- Bugfix: Database filename/path with umlauts could not be opened.
- Bugfix in sql.m: [+#] key evaluation deleted 1 char too much.
- mksqlite handles named binding with struct argument.
- SQLite update to 3.10.2.
- Updated buildit.m for mac users.

Version 2.1  (build 98 - 28. Aug. 2015)
- Bugfix: Not all SQLite errors were caught and passed to the user (kv69).
- Bugfix: When using SELECT statements with param_wrapping is on, only
  the last result was returned (kv69).
- Returning rowid on queries as 4th parameter (even when using parameter wrapping).
- sql.m handles struct parameter for parameter binding (kv69).
- DEELX update to 1.3
- SQLite update to 3.8.11.1
* (Thanks to Knut Voigtlaender (kv69) for supporting)

Version 2.0  (build 92 - 04. Feb. 2015)
- Structural cleanup of "one file source" to "multiple file sources"
- Added support for parameter wrapping
  mksqlite('param_wrapping', 0|1)
  (Default is off)
- Added support for different results types for table queries:
  0: array of structs (default)
  1: struct of arrays
  2: cell matrix
  mksqlite('result_type', 0|1|2)
- mksqlite returns row count and column names for table queries now
  [result,rowcount,colnames] = mksqlite('SELECT...')
- Source documentation with doxygen
- python filter function for doxygen (python must be installed)
- Added new sql user math functions (lg, ln, exp)
- Added wrapper function sql(...) with sprintf feature (see script help)
- SQLite update to version 3.8.8.1

Version 1.15 (build 71 - 13. Oct 2014)
- Large integer values (INT64) suffered from numeric fuzziness of double types.
  They now will be returned as INT64 MATLAB type. (Thanks to Alan Race)
- Added English translation "mksqlite_en.m"  (Thanks to Walter Blume)

Version 1.14 (build 65 - 23. Apr 2014 )
- Supporting storage of any combination of structs, cells and complex 
  numbers as blob using an undocumented Matlab feature to get a byte stream
  from any MATLAB variable.
  Please bear in mind, that nevertheless, there can be no guarantee that 
  this feature will work in future MATLAB versions. But for now it works
  excellent.
  If this feature is activated via mksqlite('typedBLOBs',2) you can't pass
  multiple arguments for parameter binding in one cell any more (because
  this cell would be passed as argument for the first SQL parameter).
  Each parameter has to be passed as argument list then.
- SQLite update 3.8.4.3
- Added option mksqlite( db, 'enable extension', 0|1 ) to support
  additional libraries. For further information about extensions 
  see www.sqlite.org.
- Added two additional compressors 'qlin16' and 'qlog16' (for double 
  arrays only). Doubles are stored quantized to 16-bit to obtain a compression
  ratio of 25%. Due to the quantization, this compression method is a lossy one,
  but reasonable in most cases.
  Use linear quantization (qlin16) for an uniform quantization error over 
  the whole range, or logarithmic quantization (qlog16)for an uniform 
  value-relative quantization error.
- Added function sql.m as example how to simplify mksqlite calls with more
  complex SQL string generation.
- Added patch to be conform with Mac OSX and binary (thanks to Stefan Balke)

Version 1.13 (build 53 - 23. Jan 2014 )
- SQLite Engine updated to Version 3.8.2
- Optional parameters for open command (SQL) to set file access mode 
  and multi-threading mode (single threaded, multi threaded or serialized)
  mksqlite( 'open', {filename} [,{access_mode}] [,{threading_mode}] )
  {access_mode} can be 'ro', 'rw' or 'rwc' (not case sensitive)
  {threading_mode} can be 'single', 'multi' or 'serial' (not case sensitive)
- Strict field names: Only alphanumeric chars and '_' are allowed
- Parameter binding extension
- Tiny exception handling implementation
- Introducing "typed BLOBs"
  Behavior can be changed by switch mksqlite('typedBLOBs', 0|1)
  (Default is OFF)
- Added two new commands:
  mksqlite('version mex'): Returns the release version of mksqlite
  mksqlite('version sql'): Returns the version of the used SQLite engine
- Data compression (BLOSC lib) for typed blobs. Set the compression method by
  mksqlite( 'compression', {method}, {level} )
  {method} can be 'blosclz', 'lz4' or 'lz4hc' (not case sensitive)
  {level} ranges between 0 and 9. 0 means no compression, 9 means max. compression.
  Compressed data is by default checked, if decompressed equals to original. You can 
  disable this behavior by
  mksqlite( 'compression_check', 0|1 );
- Added more SQL functions:
  * pow(x,y): power function x**y
  * regex(str,pattern,<repstr>): Regular expression pattern on str, replacements
    by optional parameter repstr definition. 
    (Based on DEELX V1.2 Rev.864, see www.regexlab.com)  
    Including example file "test_regex.m"
  * md5(x): calculates the MD5 digest of data x.
    (see sqlite_test_md5_and_packaging.m for example)
  * bdcpacktime(x): calculates the time needing to compress data x with current 
    compressor type and level.
  * bdcunpacktime(x): calculates the time needing to decompress data x with current 
    compressor type and level.
  * bdcratio(x): calculates the compression ratio relying on data x and
    current compressor type and level.
- Bugfix: matlab crash when no arguments passed to mksqlite
- Insertion of svn revision number into source code for linux too, now 
- Switch to return NULL as NaN applied: mksqlite('NullAsNaN', 0|1)
  (Default is OFF)

Version 1.12 (Build 34 - 29. Apr 2012)
- SQLite Engine updated to Version 3.7.11
- Unique field names for duplicate database fields (eg JOINed Databases)
  Behavior can be changed by switch mksqlite('check4uniquefields', 0|1)
- UTF8 to Latin1 conversion
  Behavior can be changed by switch mksqlite('convertUTF8', 0|1)
